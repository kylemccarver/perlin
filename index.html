<h1>CS354 Final Graphics Project: Perlin Noise Animated Terrain</h1>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>
Perlin noise is a pseudo-random algorithm that produces smooth noise by combining 
multiple smooth noise functions. Each noise function is defined by an
amplitude (range of values), frequency (period over which data is sampled)
and persistence (level of influence contributed by the function). These
functions are often referred to as "octaves." To create smooth noise,
the values contributed by each octave are scaled by their persistence and
interpolated together to produce a final noise texture with more structure
than pure random noise.
</p>
<p>
Perlin noise is often used for procedural generation of natural-looking
textures. The scope of its applications have ranged from movies and games to
image processing. It can generate terrain, produce animated textures,
 model population densities, and create artistically interesting effects.
</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
In this project, 3D Perlin noise is used to create an array of height maps.
The values in each height map are interpreted as vertex positions in space, 
so that OpenGL can construct geometry to render a 3D surface. The surface is
then shaded based on the height at a particular vertex to mimic the appearance
of terrain. Finally, to animate the terrain, the current height map is swapped
out for the next map in the array which produces new geometry, creating the
appearence of dynamically changing terrain.<br><br>

My project has three map types:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Perlin</li>
	<li>sin(x + y)</li>
	<li>sin(x^2 + y^2)</li>
</ul>

The user is able to change the height of the terrain and select the map type, 
as well as parameterize the number of octaves, amplitude, and persistence for 
the noise octaves. For map types other than Perlin, the user can also control
the power of the function to create more interesting effects.
